sudo apt install screen
sudo apt install tmux


screen & tmux (Both are terminal multiplexer, both will allow to create multiple screens, split the screen in multiple
               windows. Both are very useful when you need to run a heavy job in a remove machine like an AWS EC2 over
               a SSH connection, if you run it and the connection is closed you will lose yor job, to avoid that you 
               can start a new screen or tmux and run the job inside there, after that you can detach and close the
               SSH connection, when you connect again you can attach again and see if the job is finished or not.
               This is useful if you need to connect to the server from another host)
