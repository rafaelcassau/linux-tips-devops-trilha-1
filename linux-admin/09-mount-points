1 - mount (Will list all mounted devices in the filesystem, mount is basically turn the partition accessible to be
          used latter on)
    mount <destination/device> <any-folder-to-be-used-as-access-point-to-the-device> (mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt)
    mount -o remount <directory>
    mount -o remount,rw <directory>
    mount -o remount,ro <directory>

2 umount (Will umount a mounted a device in the filesystem)
    umount <directory> (This directory should be mounted in the linux filesystem previously)

3 - /etc/fstap (Is the file wher you can define mount points to be executed in the boot time)
      <file system>
        /dev/sdb5 OR any other block device you want
      <mount point>
        /var OR /home OR any other of your choice
      <type>
        ext4
      <options>
        defaults
        noatime - (will not write accessed time for files it will reduce significantly the IO mainly in system that have
                   a lot of changes like an email server or even an FTP server_
        nodiratime - (will not write accessed time for directories, same as above)
        norelatime - (The same for files but for inodes)
        noexec - (will remove permition for execute anything inside this mount point, it will be removed even for root
                  user, it's useful for security reasons)
        nosuid - (
        nodev - (Will block any device creation)
      <dump> (will allow to run backups and save it in dumb files 0 for not and 1 for yes)
        0
      <pass> (will check in reboot if the filesystem should is working properly, I mean if it is not corrupted
              0 for not and 1 for yes)
        0

4 - mklost+found (will create the "lost+found" directory for a new directory that was mounted)

5 - lsof ([apt install lsof] will show all opened files in the system)
    lsof -t <directory> (will list all opened files inside this directory)
 
 Mounting a new /var folder with a new hard disk listed as sdb1

 1 - Run "df -hT" to show all partitions and storage data, "sdb1" should not be listed yet"
 2 - Run "fdisk -l /dev/sdb" will shoul the "sdb1" partition
 3 - Run "mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1" to format this partition
 4 - Run "mkdir /tmp/mount_var" to create a temporary folder to be used as an access point to the "/dev/sdb1"
 5 - Run "mount /dev/sdb1 /tmp/mount_var" to mount /dev/sdb1/ in /tmpo/mount_var, it could be /mnt for example
 6 - Run "df - hT" and ensure the /dev/sdb1 was mounted
 7 - Run "cp -a /var/* /tmp/mount_var" to copy all /var files with their attributes to the /dev/sdb1, it will use 
         tmp/mount_var as an access point but the files will be fisilly in the /dev/sdb1 not in /tmp/mount_var
 8 - Run "ls /tmp/mount_var" and ensure all the files are there except the "lost+found" directory
 9 - Run "mklost+found" to create this directory
 10 - Run "sudo vim /etc/fstab" to edit fstap file
 11 - Add "/dev/sdb1 /var ext4 defaults 0 0" in their expected columns, save and close the file
 12 - Run "rm -rf /var/*" 
 13 - Run "reboot" to restart the system
 14 - Run "df -hT" and ensure the /dev/sdb1 was mounted in /var
 15 - Run "ls -lha /var" amd emsure all the files are there, but now it is in another hard disk partition
