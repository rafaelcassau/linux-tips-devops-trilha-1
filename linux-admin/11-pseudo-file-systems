/proc and /sys follows the Unix approach, each hardware calls are associated to files.


1 - /proc
    It's the default pseudo filesystem in all linux flavors
    It's possible to see the status for each process and devices
    We can see how the Linux kernel is dealing with the hardware and the process execution
    Previously only "/proc" was used for this proposal but it began to became to big and 
        the "/sys" became to be used as well
    /proc is responsible for basic hardware, interruptions and process
        /proc/1 (Is the process 1 folder)
            cat cmdline (show cmdline executed to start this PID)
            cat environ (show the evironment variables used when this PID was executed)
            cat status (show process execution status)
            cat io (show the input and output used ports for devices)

        cd acpi (energy, interruptions and disk management folder)
        cat cpuinfo (show CPU data)
        cat interrupts (show the hardware and the system iterarions, called "interruptions)
        cat devices (show the system devices, same as /dev)
        cat dma (show memory access settings)
        cat filesystems (show all mounted and supported by the Kernel they can be virtual or fhysical)
        cat kcore (represents the memory being used by the system, be careful it can show passwords and anything
                   else loaded in memory, it is used in forense analisys)
        cat loadavg (contain execution loaded data, to see this data use "w")
        cat meminfo (show memory usage in a detailed way)
        cat misc (other system modules data)
        cat modules (show the loaded system modules "drivers")
        cat mounts (show the system mount points)
        cat uptime (show how long the machine is turned on)
        cd fs (data from the running filesystems)
        cd sys (data related to the system execution)
            cd sys/net/ipv4 (will show the ipv4 configuration files)

2 - /sys
    System devices, like the sessions that are being running by the Kernel
    Disk scan, HBA (Hos Bus Adaptor), block devices, energy saving systems and so on
    /bus (show the system bus like PCI, USB and so on)
    /block (block devices like "sda, sdb, loop1, loop2", etc)
        cat sda/power/runtime_status (show the runtime status for this hard disk, you can change configurations)
        cat sda/power/async (show if the data have being saved sync or async)
        cat loop0/removable (show 0 for not and 1 for yes, like pendrives)
    /fs
        cat ext4/features/encryption (show if criptography is supported)
        cat ext4/features/batched_discard (show if this option is supported)
    /


3 - fstrim <directory> (will discard all unused blocks only works for SSDs, it's useful because when you create and delete
                    a lot of files the blocks are not discarded, so this way you tell to the system these blocks are
                    available)
    fstrim -a (will run the command for all partitions that support discard operations)
