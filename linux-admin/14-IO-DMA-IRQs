/proc/interrupts (shows the IRQs configuration)
    cat /proc/interrupts | less

/proc/ioports (shos the IO ports configuration)
    cat /proc/ioports | less

/proc/dma (shows the (D)irect (M)emory (A)ccess, it's too old, but in the past it was used directly without requesting
           to the CPU doing that, today the default is "cascade")


IO ports are the ports that the CPU will read and write in order to get and send data, to do that the IRQ 
(Interrupt Request Line) happens, basically when a device want to send data to the CPU they should request an 
interruption, based on the interruption and the port the data can be send and read by the CPU and other devices


iqrtop - (You can also see the IRQs using "irqtop" command, to do so install "sudo apt install irqtop")

lspci - (You can list all the PCI devices using "lspci")

lsusb - (List all the USB devices)

lshw - (Will list all the hardware devices of yout computer, you should install "sudo apt install lshw")
