Firmwares

    Are peaces of code that is not compatible with the Linux Kernel, it can come as "embedeed code directly in the 
    board or even come externaly in the vendor website like binaries. They aren't free because they can have some
    strategic secrets that vendors don't want to share.
    This way to run this kind of hardware you should install the driver separately and when the Kernel boots it will
    looking for these binaries in a directory and then the Kernel will load it.

    To install this kind of vendor drivers in Debian you can follow these steps.

    1 - ls /lib/firmware (it's the place where all firmwares are placed
    2 - vi /etc/apt/sources.list (it's the place where the system find the sources where it will search for 
                                  updates, programs, packages, libraries, etc, we should edit it in order
                                  to add firmwares sources packages in the list in order to be found when
                                  we try to install it)
    3 - Find a line mostly like this one "deb http://deb/debian.org/debian/ bullseye main"
    4 - Add at the end of this line the following packages "contrib non-free" and then save and close the file 
    5 - apt-get update
    6 - apt-cache search firmware-linux-nonfree (after adding these aditional libraries the non free firmware 
                                                 packages are found)
    6 - apt-get install firmware-linux-nonfree
    7 - ls /lib/firmware (will show more packages than before)
    8 - apt-cache search firmware (will list all the available firmware packages to be installed)
    9 - apt-get install firmware-realtek firmware-samsung (will add those firmware drivers for these vendor's boards)
    10 - reboot (necessary for Kernel to be able to find and load the new firmwares installed)


Installing network firmeware without internet

    1 - run "lspci" or "lsusb" or "ls or "lshw" (apt install lshw) to figure out what are the required firmwares 
        should be installed
    2 - access debian.org/distrib/packages and find "Search package directories"
    3 - type "firmware" or "realtek" if the board is from realtek
    4 - select the firmware package and chose the archicteture, i386 for example
    5 - Download it and move it to a pendrive
    6 - Insert the pendrive in the machine where the driver should be installed and mount it
    7 - dpkg -i <package-name>.deb (to install the package)
    8 - reboot
