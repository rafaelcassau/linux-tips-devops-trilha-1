ACPI
    It's a pattern that allows a more efficient way to manage energy of devices and resources.
    Allow a more efficient iteration way between CPU and other hardware devices.
    The resources are:
        1 - Saving energy
        2 - Performance management
        3 - Suspension management
        4 - Turn off the machine the correct way using power button

To use those features above you should add a package called "acpid"

"apt-get install acpid"

It's a daemon that control and monitor the ACPI for the machine

The ACPI configuration in Debian flavors is in "/etc/acpi/"

"cat /etc/acpi/events/powerbtn-acpi-support" (is the event that handle the correct machine
                                              shutdown when the power button is pressed,
                                              it points to a sh file described bellow)

"cat /etc/acpi/powerbtn-acpi-support.sh" (Will check if there are policies that didn't
                                          allow the system shutdown, in case of none of
                                          this policies was found than it runs the 
                                          shutdown)


systemd

    If the systemd daemon has been used instead of "acpid" you should change
    "/etc/systemd/logind.conf" in order to change the power button behavior
    changing "HandlePowerKey=poweoff" to "HandlePowerKey=ignore" will change
    the correct shutdown for just turn off the energy.
