Debian distros

  1 - dpkg
    dpkg is the default debian flavor distros package management tool, with it you will be able to install, uninstall,
    list and change configuration of installed packages.
    To install a debian package using it you should have the package in the local machine.
    An important point is that, it not resolve dependencies, it means, if a packageA dependes of a packageB you should
    download and install packageB first and only after that you should install packageA
  
      dpkg -i <package_name>.deb (install the given .deb local package
      dpkg -l (list all installed packages)
      dpkg -l firefox (show data about the firefox instalation, if it not print nothing it means the firefox is not 
                       installed)
      dpkg -r firefox (remove the given program, in this example firefox, only remove the program, remaining data like
                       docs, dependencies, cache can stay at the machine, if you run "dpkg -l firefox" the output will
                       be the type of "rc" meaning it was removed but remaining configuration files is still there)
      dpkg -P firefox (remove firefox and all configuration files, etc, "P" means "purge")
      dpkg -L firefox (list all files owned by this program)
      dpkg -S <path-of-a-file> (list who program is the owner of this file)
      dpkg -I <package_name>.deb (show a bunch of information about the package)
      dpkg -s firefox (show a bunch of information about the installed program)
      dpkg -C (will looking for corrupted installed packages in the system)
      dpkg --configure <program> (you can change the configuration of a given program)
  
  
  2 - apt-get
    apt-get is the default package manament system of the Debian flavor distros, in fact it will not install the packages
    it will delegate it to "dpkg", but different from "dpkg" it will find the package over the remote package servers added
    in "/etc/apt/sources.list" it will also resolve dependencies by itself and will download all of then, after that it 
    calls "dpkg" to install it.
  
      apt-get install firefox
      apt-get reinstall firefox
      apt-get remove firefox
      apt-get purge firefox
      apt-get download firefox
      apt-get autoremove (remove automatically all unused packages)
      apt-get update (update the package list, it avoid to run search for the packages when you need to install it, this
                      way you can keep the available package list always updated)
      apt-get upgrade (will upgrade the whole system with patchs and software updates, etc)
      apt-key add - (will add a key to ensure the package you are downloading is trustable, it means the package will not
                     come from a malicious server, etc)
      apt-get clean (will clean all the downloaded packages saved in "/var/cache/apt/archives/")
      apt-cache show firefox (show the details of this program in the system)
      apt-cache depends firefox (show which packages firefox depends on)
  
  
  3 - /etc/apt/sources.list
    it's the default sources.list file where the system will look for when you need to upgrade the system or when you
    need to upgrade a package or install a new package.
    When the package is not listed like "docker", "google-chrome" for example you should add the package in this file.
    But it's recommended to create a new file in the "/etc/apt/sources.list.d/<package>.list" because this way you can
    segregate which are the system default packages and which are your own packages.
    Everytime you add a new repository in the sources.list you should run "apt-get update" in order to the system update
    the package list.
      deb [arch=amd64] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com focal main
        deb - (It's a debian binary packages)
        deb-src - (It's the source code packages, you can download, compile and install by yourself)
        [arch=amd64] - (It's the system archicteture that the packages are compatible with)
        http://xxxx  - (It's the web server where the packages will be fetched and downloaded)
        focal        - (It's the ubuntu version, yes the versions are named)
        main         - (It's the package type, in this case it will download the main package, it could be "restricted"
                        for example and so on)
  
  
  4 - /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
    It's the place to add your new dependencies like the listed bellow.
    Don't forget to run a "apt-get update" after adding these new repositories.
    Only after these steps you are able to install the package itself.  
        docker.list
        google-chrome.list
  
  
  5 - /var/cache/apt/archives/
    It's the place where the downloaded apt-get files are saved as a cache, it means if for any reason you need to install
    thge package again the "apt-get install" will try to find the package in this directory first in order to avoid
    downloading it again.
