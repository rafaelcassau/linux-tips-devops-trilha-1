  When you need to create a variable with more than one word you should use double quotes "" i.e
  export VAR_NAME=" var value"

  When you need to put multiple values in a variable you should use ":" as delimiter i.e
  export VAR_NAME=var_value_1:var_value_2
  export LANG=pt_BR.UTF-8:en_US.UTF-8


7 - unset VAR_NAME
  Remove the given environment variable


8 - alias
  alias will create useful alias for your commands, it's useful to facilitate the day to day job when you need to use
  the same command a lot of time or even when you need to run complex commands, for these cases you can create a simple
  alias for that.
    alias new_ls="ls -lha"

    If you want to save the alias and use it forever you should add this command in "~/.bashrc" or in "~/.profile"

    alias
      List all aliases created in the system


8 - unalias
  unalias new_ls

    again


14 - /etc/profile
  It's like "~/.bashrc" but every command you put here will be applied globally for all the linux users


15 - /etc/profile.d/
  Instead of changing the default "/etc/profile" you can add your own global ".sh" files into this directory and they
  will be ran for all the system users. 


16 - ~/.profile
  It works exactly like the "~/.bashrc" and the scope is restrict only for the user instead global


17 - PS1
  It's the default variable that is responsible to print the user@machine in the terminal, it shows if the user is root
  or if it is just a normal user, you can change the default behavior changing it in "~/.bashrc" file


18 - /etc/environment
  It's the correct file where you can define environment variables for all system user, you can add those variables in
  another files like "~/.bashrc", "~/.profile" and it will work properly, but the correct place is here.
