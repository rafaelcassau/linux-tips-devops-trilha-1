File types (ls -lha /dev)

(-) File
(d) Directory
(l) Symbolic link
(b) Block device, HD, pen drive
(c) Caracter device, sending and receiving information (terminal, tty)


Directories

/ (Root directory - first Linux directory)

/bin
 - system binaries (ls, cd, vim), etc.

/boot
 - system initial files (grub, kernel), etc

/dev
 - system devices (HD, CPU), everything is a file in Linux (abstraction, interface)

   sda   - SSD
   sda1  - SSD 1st primary partition
   sda2  - SSD 2st primary partition
   sda5  - SSD 1st logic partition
   sdb   - Second hard SSD
   lp    - Print port
   tty   - Terminal
   ttyS1 - Serial port
   psaux - Mouse

/etc
 - configuration/settings files (nginx, apache, samba)

/home
 - main directory for each user 

/lib (lib32|lib64)
 - System essential libraries
   (.so) files are (compiled library files) "Shared Object" like Windows DDLs
   (.ko) files are programs used by the Kernel, for example drivers for network, etc
        /lib/modules/5.15.0-53-generic/kernel/drivers/net/ethernet/realtek

/lost+found
 - All the file systems that have Journal (way to recover files when the machine turn down for an energy outage)
   will have this folder where the files are save in order to be able recover them.

/media
 - All the devices will be mounted under this directory (CD-ROM, penddrive), etc

/mnt
 - Temporary mounting point (ISO) for example

/opt
 - Main directory for all the softwares that are installed i.e (libre office, google chrome) etc

/proc
 - It's a virtual filesystem (this directory doesn't exist fisically) who is responsible to create it is the Kernel
   and other process, you could see for example CPU data using (cat cpuinfo), dynamic information about the system
   
   When some process is running in the Linux it creates a directory inside /proc in order to create temporary files
   that should be used for this process, (PID) is the process number, is the way to identify the running process

/root
 - It's the home directory for the root user, it is the unique user directory that lives outside of the home directory

/run
 - Dynamic data related to the system, who is the logged users, and so on, it's a temporary file, it is created dynamically
   when the system is being initialyzed

/sbin
 - bynary files that only the super user can execute, for example, (adduser, deluser), etc

/srv
 - Server file, i.e (CVS, FTP, webserver HTML pages), etc

/sys
 - Files related to system information like, (firmware, kernel, devices, drivers), etc

/tmp
 - It is a temporary directory, all files inside this directory will be removed when the system is restarted
   Applications can use this directory for ephemeral files.

/usr (second Linux directory)
 - It provides a similar (/) structure but for the users, not essential for the system itself
 - /bin   - not essential binaries (user binaries)
 - /sbin  - not essential root binaries
 - /lib   - not essential libraries
 - /share - documentation and all shareable data
 - /src   - source code for any application you will compile or run, for example python scripts, shell scripts, etc
 - /src/local - (third Linux Directory)
   - All the essential local (specific) data that will not be shareable through network, i.e (kubctl)

/var
 - Variable data, i.e system logs (/var/logs), system backups (/var/backups), system cache (/var/cache), all the "apt"
   downloaded packages will be inside the (cache/apt/archives), system metadata, docker volumes, kubernets (/var/lib),
   etc
