* - wildcard that is evaluated to 0, 1 or many characters

    ls a*  (will list all files that starts with "a")
    ls *a  (will list all files that ends with "a")
    ls a*r (will list all files that starts with "a" and ends with "r")

? - wildcard that is evaluated to 1 character

    ls m?  (will list any file that starts with "m" and have just 1 character after the "m")
    ls m?? (Same as above but it will list any file that will have 2 characters after the "m")

Compound both

    ls a?t* (will return any file that starts with "a" and after 1 character have the "t" letter and after that it can
             have none or many other characters)

[] - wildcard that will consider a range of valid characters

    ls m[a-c]  (will list any file that will start with "m" and ends with "a, b or c")
    ls m[^a-c] (will list any file that will start with "m" and NOT ends with "a, b or c" because "^" means denial)

{} - wildcard that will add "OR" operation option for each parameter you will pass in the list, it can show duplicated 
     results because it will repeat the search for each parameter given in the list {param1, param2}

    ls x{zd,ze,zm} (will list any file that stars with "x" and will have "zd OR ze OR zm" in the rest of the name)

Compound all

     ls w?[d-z]*{list,comp}* (will list any file that starts with "w" and after one character will have any character
                              between "d and z", after that it can have 0 or many characters following the words
                              "list OR comp" following with 0 or many characters.
                              If you run it in the "/usr/bin" it will return "word-list-compress" binary file
